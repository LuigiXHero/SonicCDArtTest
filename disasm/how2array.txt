ok so each zone is a slot in the 2D array and each eact is a slot for each zone slot
the first thing we need to do is calculate the pointer of the zone slot, since its the primary array
so each zone slot includes 4  pointers
thats 16 bytes
so u would have to move the zone id into d0 and multiply it by 16
now we can move on to the acts
each act slot is a longword
what we can do is move the act id into d1 or something and multiply it by 4
and then add to d0
and thats ur final value
and then do the normal lea or movea thing and ur good to go
